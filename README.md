Second print for Open Source 3D Fabrication. 

The assignment for my second print required me to create a drawing of something that was 6 cm in the largest dimension. I was interested in creating something using the "hull" and "translate" tools. I ended up creating something similar to a military dog tag. I wanted the print to be relatively flat and I gave it an interesting zipper pattern. While printing I only needed to print once and I executed it very well. After printing this piece I was thoroughly happy with it and felt quite comfortable with the coding process.
